# TYMPASS 💻🧠

Welcome to **TYMPASS** — my personal coding lab, learning journal, and knowledge vault.

This repository is a reflection of my continuous journey to master **C programming**, **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, and **Web Development**.  
Every file here is a milestone — whether it's solving a tricky problem, experimenting with a new concept, or simply practicing fundamentals.
